    "Consider the linear model with an intercept term $ Y=\\beta_{0}+X\\beta+\\epsilon$ .When some of the columns of X\n",
    "  are nearly collinear (as is likely when $p$\n",
    "  is nearly as large as n), the determinant of $X^{T}X $\n",
    " , which is the square of the volume of the parallelepiped whose edges are the columns of $X$\n",
    " , is nearly 0. Thus, since a determinant is the product of the eigenvalues, at least one of the eigenvalues of $ \\left(X^{T}X\\right)^{-1} $\n",
    " is very large. But  $$ \\hat{\\beta}\\sim N_{p}\\left(\\beta,\\,\\sigma^{2}\\left(X^{T}X\\right)^{-1}\\right) $$\n",
    " , at least when the columns of X\n",
    "  are orthogonal to (1,1,1,...,1,1)^{T}\n",
    " , and the sum of the eigenvalues is the trace, so at least one of the components of \\hat{\\beta}\n",
    "  has very large variance. We therefore seek to shrink \\hat{\\beta}\n",
    "  towards the origin. This will introduce a bias, but we hope it will be more than compensated by a reduction in variance. \n",
